<p>On Friday, we were playing chess:

<p>But we didn't stop there, we stayed up all night playing Settlers of Catan(I won, by the way):

<p>Without much sleep, we attend our first Hackathon:

<p>Our lead programmer, Richard Cui(above), with the help of Monster drinks wrote thousand lines of code without much sleep:

<p>Our front-end programmer, Diane Tam(in short sleeve, next to my pillow), designed the most beautiful interface I've ever seen:

<p>And this is me, SeihakRithy Muth, after being awake for more than 48 hours:

<p>I'd like to thanks all the sponsors and organizers of HackUMass for giving us such a great opportunity and a great time!</p>

<a id="what-did-we-make" class="anchor" href="#what-did-we-make" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What did we make?</h1>

<p>A team-based game of chess called Bughouse. Bughouse is a game of 4 players, 2 on each team. Regular chess rules apply, except when a piece is captured, the capturer gives the piece to their ally, which can then place the piece at any point during their turn on their board. It is a game of strategy, tactics and a lot of chess pieces traveling between the boards.</p>

<p>Our lead programmer, Richard Cui, did a great job coding almost everything, especially networking and UI:

<p>Our front-end developer, Diane Tam, designed the most beautiful GUI for chess game:
